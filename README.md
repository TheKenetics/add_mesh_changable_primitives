# add_mesh_changable_primitives
Blender Addon that creates primitives that can be changed after they are created and moved/scaled/etc.

## What
Creates Changable Primitives which are primitives that can be changed even after they are moved, rotated, scaled, etc.  
Great for starting rough models.  
### Features
* Supports Linked Objects  
Changable Primitives duplicated with Linked Duplicate will share properties.

## Installation  
### Requirements  
Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.  
Meant for Blender 2.8 Beta
### How to Install  
Download the repository, Clone or Download > Download ZIP (put it in a place where you can easily find it, like your desktop)  
In Blender's settings, go to the addons tab  
At the bottom, click "Install from File"  
Find where you put the ZIP file, select it, and click "Install from File" 

## Using
You can add a modifier empty from...
* 3D View > Add Menu > Mesh > Changable Primtives
* 3D View > Operator Search > Create \*Changable Primitive name\*  
## Notes
Sometimes entering Edit mode after creating a Changable Primitive will cause odd shading to happen.  
Leaving and entering Edit mode again usually corrects the shading.
